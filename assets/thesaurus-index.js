Authority File
 SN A flat (non-hierarchical) list containing preferred terms. May include variant terms. Essentially, an authority file is a synonym ring with the preferred term identified for each concept.

Broader Term
 SN The superordinate word in an inclusion or hierarchical relationship. A class or category term. Abbreviated in displays as “BT.” The inversion of broader term is narrower term. For example, “shoe” is a broader term than “running shoe.” Broader terms are sometimes referred to as “parent” terms.

Card Sorting
 SN An exercise that can be used to help create a controlled vocabulary. In a card sort, users are asked to group cards into like categories or to name categories of like items. Card sorting can be used to compile lists of variant terms or to verify the relationships in a hierarchy. For additional information, see Card-Based Classification Evaluation by Donna Maurer or the IAWiki page on card sorting.

Controlled Vocabulary
 SN A subset of natural language that is used to tag documents and then to find content through navigation or search. Use of a controlled vocabulary increases consistency in tagging and can help match users’ natural language with preferred terms. Abbreviated as “CV.” Controlled vocabularies exhibit the following relationships:

Equivalence Relationship
 SN The connection between terms in a synonym ring , or between preferred terms and variant terms. Terms that exhibit an equivalence relationship refer to the same concept. For example, “cat” and “feline” are often considered as being equivalent.

Exhaustivity
 SN The range of concept coverage of vocabulary terms in a controlled vocabulary. If the vocabulary terms cover all of the concepts included in the content under consideration, then the controlled vocabulary is exhaustive.

Facet
 SN A fundamental category by which an object or concept may be described. For example, a child’s ball may be described using the facets of size, weight, shape, color, texture, material and price.

 SN The level of specificity with which content is described. The more granular, the more specific.

Hierarchy
 SN A collection of vocabulary terms that show levels of superordination and subordination. Hierarchies comprise broader terms and narrower terms. Hierarchies may be testing using card sorting.

Literary Warrant
 SN The inclusion of a vocabulary term in a controlled vocabulary based on its appearance in one or more content items. For example, a medical text may use the term “oncology.” Based on literary warrant, that term would be included in the controlled vocabulary even though the general public uses the term “cancer.”
 RT User Warrant

Narrower Term
 SN The subordinate word in an inclusion or hierarchical relationship. A member or part. Abbreviated in displays at “NT.” For example, “running shoe” is a narrower term than “shoe.” Narrower terms are sometimes referred to as “child” terms.The inversion of narrower term is broader term.

Precision
 SN A ratio that measures the success of a search. Precision is defined mathematically as the number of relevant items returned by a search divided by the total number of items returned by the search. Thus, a search that returned only relevant items would have a precision of 1.0.

Recall
 SN A ratio that measures the success of a search. Recall is defined mathematically as the number of relevant items returned by a search divided by the total number of relevant items in the collection. Thus, a search that returned all the relevant items in a collection would have a recall of 1.0.

Related Term
 SN Vocabulary terms in a controlled vocabulary that are closely related. That is, they refer to closely related concepts. Abbreviated in displays as “RT.” Related terms may, for example, exhibit the following relationships: field of study/objects studied operation/agent action/product of action concepts/properties agent/counter-agent concept/opposite

Specificity
 SN The exactness with which a vocabulary term covers a concept. Thus, in considering the concept “dog,” the term “canine” is more specific than “animal.” Increasing specificity of vocabulary terms increases precision and granularity , but may decrease recall.

Thesaurus
 SN Acontrolled vocabulary that indicates preferred terms and variant terms. In addition to the equivalence relationship , vocabulary terms in a thesaurus exhibit both hierarchical and associative relationships. These three relationships are called “standard thesaural relationships.” Thesauri are usually considered the most complex of controlled vocabularies.

Variant Term
 SN Avocabulary term that means nearly the same thing as a preferred term. Variant terms are used in the controlled vocabulary to provide entry terms that lead to preferred terms. Variant terms may include synonyms, lexical variants, quasi-synonyms and abbreviations. Variant terms are sometimes referred to as “entry terms.” The collection of all variant terms may be referred to as the “entry vocabulary.”
